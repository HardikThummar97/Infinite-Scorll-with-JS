# Infinite Scroll whit HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
* Trying to replicate the common practice that is being used by most content heavy sites i.e, facebook, instagran etc...
* Purpose is to load the amount of data the is necessary at that moment only, rather that loading hundreds of posts at once, which user might not want to see at moment! and offcourse to save user's bandwith.

## How to use project ?

* Install json-sever to use existing data, or you can modify for your own data as well!
```
npm i json-server
```
* run it for existing data in db.json file
```
json-server --watch --port 3001 db.json
```
* kept all html,css and js together in single file only. You know what to do next.
